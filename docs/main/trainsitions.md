# Transitions

## Theory

Transitions are mechanism by which the StateMachine models changes in state.
A transition is described by an `action` such as **next** and a "from" and "to" `state` such as **a** and **b**:

```
+-----------+            +-----------+    next    +-----------+
|           |    next    |           |  ------->  |           |
|     a     |  ------->  |     b     |            |     c     |
|           |            |           |  <-------  |           |
+-----------+            +-----------+    back    +-----------+
```

The StateMachine configuration options allows you to describe the above transition in plain English like this:

```
next : a > b > c
back :     b < c
```

It should be noted that a `from` state's actions will be _unique_ (it doesn't make sense to have two "next"s for example) and generally only one action would go (directly) to one state (though in theory you could have 2 actions going to the same state):

```
                         +-----------+
                         |           |
                         |     b     |
+-----------+    next    |           |
|           |  ------->  +-----------+
|     a     |
|           |  ------->  +-----------+
+-----------+    exit    |           |
                         |     x     |
                         |           |
                         +-----------+
```

You can then describe the journey around a system of states in terms actions, in a linear or non-linear fashion as required.

The actual _transit_ of a transition is expressed inside the `StateMachine` in more detail as **events** of the component parts:

- The action has a `start` and `end` event
- The states have a `leave` and `enter` event

As the transition executes, the events occur in this order:

1. `action.start`
2. `state.leave`
3. `state.enter`
4. `action.end`

Illustrated like so:

    +-----------+     +-----------+
    |           |     |           |
    |     1 --- 2 --- 3 --> 4     |
    |           |     |           |
    +-----------+     +-----------+

These events give us a mechanism to hook into state changes, either at the `action` or `state` level, allowing us to run code and crucially _control_ transitions, either cancelling, pausing or resuming by registering and running handler functions:

    +-----------+     +-----------+
    |           |     |           |
    |     a --------> x     b     |  not allowed to "enter" state b
    |           |     |           |
    +-----------+     +-----------+

As such, the Transition class itself is merely a _queueing system_ for event handlers, with functionality to pause, resume and cancel the queue.

## Practice

Handlers are added to transitions by by the [fsm.on()](../api/statemachine.md#on) method.

Handlers can be attached to **named** states and actions such as `a` or `next`, or **all** states and handlers with `*`.
 
Additionally, the [handler syntax](../config/handlers.md) allows attaching handlers to any action or state event such as `action.start` or `state.enter`.


This gives use the following available opportunities to hook into any transition, which by default run in this order:

    action.*.start
    action.{action}.start
    state.*.{action}
    state.{from}.{action}
    state.{from}.leave
    state.*.leave
    state.*.enter
    state.{to}.enter
    action.{action}.end
    action.*.end

This might seem like a lot of function calls, but hooks are *only* called if registered.

Like normal event handlers, you can add as many handlers per hook as you need to; they are called in the order they are added.

Note the special `{from}.{action}` entry, which conveniently allows you to attach handlers for actions directly to states:

```
fsm.on('form@next', onSubmitForm);
```

In practice, you'll likely only hook into a few events per system, so the total number of functions called will be minimal.
