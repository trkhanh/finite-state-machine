# Events

## Overview

StateMachine, like many other systems, uses events to communicate changes in a decoupled manner.

There are four different event types to respond to, which correlate to the main parts of the system that is undergoing change:

- [SystemEvents](#systemevent) - such as starting, when the configuration is changed, or reaching the final state
- [TransitionEvents](#transitionevent) - when a transition is paused, resumed or cancelled
- [StateEvents](#stateevent) - when a state event handler is triggered
- [ActionEvents](#actionevent) - when an action even handler is triggered

To hook into an event, you need to add an event handler with an event handler shorthand, and a callback to run Javascript code:

```js
var fsm = new StateMachine(options);
fsm.on('from@next', function(event, fsm){
    console.log('About to submit the form...')
})
```

All events pass two arguments by default: the actual `Event` object and a reference to the owning `StateMachine`

The event handler shorthand (to hook into different events) is discussed at length [here](../config/handlers.md).

## SystemEvent
SystemEvents are called in response to system level event handler 

<h4>
	<a name="system.start" href="#system.start">#</a>
	<code>start</code>
</h4>
Fired when the StateMachine starts.

Useful to lazily wire up any UI, especially for delayed starts (where the FSM option start is set to false).

<h4>
	<a name="system.start" href="#system.change">#</a>
	<code>change</code>
</h4>

When a transition has completed and there is a change of state. Check the event source to see what the state is, or even the fsm.state:

```js
function onCHange (event, fsm) {
    event.source === fsm.state;
}
```

<h4>
    <a name="system.complete" href="#system.complete">#</a>
    <code>complete</code>
</h4>

Fired when the state reaches the final state.

The final state is either implicitly declared as the last state parsed while adding transitions, or explicitly declared in options as final.

<h4>
    <a name="system.reset" href="#system.reset">#</a>
    <code>reset</code>
</h4>

When `fsm.reset()` method is called, and the StateMachine has reset to the initial state.

## TransitionEvent
<h4>
    <a name="system.pause" href="#system.pause">#</a>
    <code>pause</code>
</h4>

Fired when the StateMachine has been paused or unpaused via `fsm.pause()` or `fsm.resume()`.

Hook into this state to update the UI, such as locking it, or displaying a loading icon. Check for paused state via the event's value property:

```js
function onPause (event, fsm) {
    $loadingIcon.toggleClass('block', event.value);
}
```

<h4>
    <a name="system.cancel" href="#system.cancel">#</a>
    <code>cancel</code>
</h4>

Fired when a transition has been cancelled.

Because a cancelled transition doesn't change teh StateMachine's state, listen for this event to update any already-updating UI, for example to stop any animation, or hide loading icons.

## State Event
StateEvents are called when state event handlers are triggered.

They give the opportunity to run JavaScript code, as well as modify the transition, such as pausing it or cancelling it.

## ActionEvent
ActionEvents are the same as StateEvents, but for actions.
